# Constitutional AI Governance Infrastructure (CAGI) — Governance Bundle (v1.0)

**Public category + constitutional governance layer. Constitution-only repository.**

> **The constitutional stack does not depend on industry data aggregation. It governs how intelligence—however produced—is allowed to influence decisions.**

---

## What this is

This repository publishes **CAGI v1.0** as a named public category and provides a **constitution-grade governance bundle** designed to:

- preserve **human authority** over decisions
- prevent **surveillance posture** by design
- prevent **urgency pressure** and “alert hunger”
- enforce **non-agency** and consequence proportionality (C0 / C1 / C2)
- allow **silence** as a valid output
- enable **quiet system stewardship** (drift visibility without control)

This is **infrastructure**, not a product.

---

## The constitutional stack (language-only)

- **CLP (Constitutional Language Protocol):** governs how systems express meaning  
- **CCBP (Consciousness–Capability Boundary Project):** governs what systems are allowed to do  
- **CAGI (Constitutional AI Governance Infrastructure):** governs how intelligence may surface and influence humans  

Compact form:

> **CLP governs expression.**  
> **CCBP governs capability.**  
> **CAGI governs influence.**

## What’s included

- **CAGI v1.0 public category freeze** (definition + boundary)
- **Quiet Stewardship Constitution** (axioms + archons)
- **Machine-enforceable constraints** (YAML)
- **Blind-spot → Archon mapping** (coverage and suppression rules)
- **Amendment procedure** + **draft amendment sunset rule**
- **Weekly digest template** (pattern view; non-urgent; silence-valid)
- **Board/public explainers** (“why this is not surveillance” + “why restraint is intentional”)

---

## What’s intentionally NOT included

To keep this repo **constitution-only**, it does **not** include:

- entity-specific overlays (risk profiles, internal policies, operational guardrails)
- connectors, keys, telemetry, or internal logs
- competitive strategy artifacts (targets, pipelines, playbooks, pricing)
- implementation details that enable operational inference
- any “autonomous execution” logic

Those belong in **private** or **entity-bound** overlays.

## Licensing / rights

Licensing is **negotiable** and **context-dependent** by design.

- This bundle is published as constitutional infrastructure, not IP leverage.
- If a license is required for clarity or interoperability, the preferred posture is **permissive and non-extractive**.

(If you need a formal license file for downstream adopters, add it explicitly. Otherwise, treat this repository as constitutional reference material.)

---

## Change policy (constitutional)

- **v1.0 is frozen.**
- Changes require explicit amendment drafting and review.
- Draft amendments **sunset automatically** unless reaffirmed.
- No silent evolution. No creeping scope.
